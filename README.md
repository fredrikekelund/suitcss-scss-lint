# scss-lint config for SUITCSS conventions

I like [SUITCSS](https://github.com/suitcss) (read up on it in [this excellent blog post](https://medium.com/@fat/mediums-css-is-actually-pretty-fucking-good-b8e2a6c78b06)), and I like SASS with all of its preprocessing bells and whistles. So I'm linting my project setup with this config.

The most advanced thing in here is the selector name matching, which by the way also permits Angular style classes, like `ng-invalid` etc.
